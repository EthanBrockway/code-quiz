## My Task 

### As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

### To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## User Story

# As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores, so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## Acceptance Criteria

### GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
### When I click the start button, then a timer starts and I am presented with a question
### When I answer a question, then I am presented with another question
### When I answer a question incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the clock
### When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over
### When the game is over, then I can save my initials and score
